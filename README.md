My reflections for the week2 assignment:

I think I have hit all the minimum requirements and 2-3 stretch ones too. I didn't do the two strech goals that required JavaScript as I'm not confident with the language and the code implementation confused me.

For some reason, even though we were still using HTML and CSS, I found this week's assignment more difficult than last week. I think it was my mindset and personal circumstances were the issue- not the assignment.

Other challenges I faced were with the logos in the footer and making the nav prettier.

On a more positive note, I always manage to see something that can be improved with my code after being AFK for a bit.
