My reflections for the week2 assignment:

For some reason, even though we were still using HTML and CSS, I found this week's assignment more difficult than last week. I think it was my mindset and personal circumstances were the issue- not the assignment.

On a more positive note, I always manage to see something that can be improved with my code after being AFK for a bit.
